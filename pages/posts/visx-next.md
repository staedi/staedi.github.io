## State of the visx (until recently)

As I introduced in [a article](visx), `visx` is a brilliant adaption of `D3.js` with `Typescript` and `React.js` in mind. In the same time, however, version **3.0+** failed to live well with `Next.js`.

To tackle this issue, a few workarounds have been proposed as follows.

* Install version 2.18.0 (the last working version with Next.js)
* Use dynamic import with next/dynamic with SSR disabled

### Install version 2.18.0

This is for someone who doesn't like to modify any codes or who uses `visx` visualization component in `MDX`, use version **2.18.0** is the only feasible option. While this wouldn't support any new features introduced in the **3.0**, it didn't cause any problems in my `.mdx` files.

### Use dynamic import with next/dynamic with SSR disabled

If `visx` is used in normal `Javascript` / `Typescript` codes, this option works well with version **3.0+**.


***Instead of***
```js
import MyLineChart from './MyLineChart';
```

***Try this***
```js
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
const MyLineChart = dynamic(() => import('./MyLineChart'), { ssr: false });
```


## Wait is over!

Now, thanks to the version **3.2** update, this cumbersome and unwelcome workarounds are not any longer needed.

Just update your visx package and enjoy your visualization!
