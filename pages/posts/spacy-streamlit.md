## spaCy?
[spaCy](https://spacy.io) is an open-source NLP module by [explosion.ai](https://explosion.ai). Unlike `nltk` module, which is aimed at research purposes, this targets production-ready codes. As such, it is powered with Cython, delivering faster performance than its counterpart (*not POS tagging, though*), also with more straightforward functionalities to streamline advanced NLP works.


## streamlit
This is my favorite Python module, with which you can show your works ranging from **Data Visualization** to **Machine Learning** projects or **NLPs**. Unlike its competitor, `Dash` by plot.ly team or `ShinyR`, it doesn't require you to write boilerplate codes for the document structure. Even then, the resulting markup looks more pretty beautiful. If it doesn't I wouldn't have started using this.

## spacy-streamlit
`streamlit` has several modules which can enhance it with added functionalities. As `spaCy` supports useful language analyses which can be better understood by visualizations, it has the graphing capabilities within it. And, `spacy-streamlit` streamline these functions, from entering your desired sentences to be analyzed to the analyzed results. This is beneficial if you want to dissect the sentence of its dependency among its components, i.e., how each verb or noun is connected to each other.

## How to start?
While you can install the module in your computer, it isn't necessary to test it. You can go to [https://explosion.ai/demos/displacy](https://explosion.ai/demos/displacy) to test it or you can install.

```python
pip install spacy-streamlit
```
