## cURL?
Shorthand of *Client URL*, `cURL` has wide-ranging purposes ranging from  downloading remote packages (such as GitHub) to emulate REST API requests (**GET** / **POST**).

As it happens, handling the latter is tricky without resorting to cURL. In most cases, you don't get the same json-dict as shown in your browsers' preview.

## cURL to Requests
First one is for the multi-purpose Requests library (`requests` library in **Python**)

[https://curl.trillworks.com](https://curl.trillworks.com)

In fact, this site provides bunch of programming languages you can convert to, not only **Python** or **Node**.

## cURL to `scrapy` (Python)

### `scrapy`
`scrapy` is one of the feature-rich scraping frameworks (as the name implies) available in Python. This is developed with Flask, so the usage is pretty much the same with other tools made with that same framework.

### cURL to scrapy Request (curl2scrapy)

[curl2scrapy](https://michael-shub.github.io/curl2scrapy/)

While the basic operation is similar to that using `requests` library, `scrapy` has slight different syntaxes and **fetch** command, which is to actually send *request* command to server and get the *response*.
