description: An introduction to Streamlit for dashboard construction
---

**Disclaimer**: Before I begin, I should point out I'm **NOT** working for [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io). I'm just a lazy developer (if I could describe myself as such), who has just become addicted with this tool.


> If you use `Python` for *data visualization* purposes, you might already know [Plot.ly](https://plotly.com), one of the most used interactive graphic modules available both in `R` and `Python`. If that's the case, you also may have visited its website and heard about [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash), an interactive web dashboard building tool made by them.

That someone was me. Although I've never used `Plot.ly` yet (even until now), I've visited the site several times and spotted their ad for Dash every time I do.

In one sense, that looked cool, I could develop web applications without knowing `Javascript` or related technologies, including `React`, `D3` among others. But I wasn't desperate or inclined to make one at the time. It looked great that I could create a dynamic web application, but I had nothing in my mind.

Some months later, after I had decent amount of time with `ggplot`, I finally felt I wanted to dive into that area. Dash was my first choice, as it was my only known option and it was available on `R`, so I might use `ggplot` on it, which was proved later, or at least not easy.

But, after I happened to see an article of comparing **Streamlit** and **Dash**, I knew it was the **One** except some caveats.

Weak points were its availability only on Python without `conda` installations. The latter was quite shocking given that I'd never seen any modules which required to used `pip` only. On top of that, even if it would enable users to install via `conda`, the developers clearly mentioned that virtual environments are **STRONGLY** recommended.

However, these drawbacks were comfortably eclipsed by how smart this program was. **Simplicity, modern feel, and flexibility**.

First, you don't have to write `HTML` codes or even follow some pseudo-like `HTML` codes. To write a text, one line is enough.

```py
import streamlit as st

x = st.slider('Select a value')
st.write(x, 'squared is', x * x)
```

In fact, this is referred as magic tool in `Streamlit`. It can be used to display DataFrame, show charts, maps, etc.

This is the core philosophy of Streamlit. No nitty-gritty of `HTML` structure. While I've never had an aversion to `HTML`, this core concept was so appealing. Even without serious style adjustments, the default style looked so modern - to my especial liking. On the plus side, I discovered after some research, I would be given handful of options in terms of charts.

I could even use [Plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io), a `ggplot` module for Python, which has more than 80% of the original, while I'm afraid that the performance isn't par to default options including [Altair](http://altair-viz.github.io/), the graphic module which Streamlit is based on.

While I've never used them before, but I could say that the default modules Streamlit is based on are quite powerful and feauture-rich, namely, `Altair` and [Pydeck](https://deckgl.readthedocs.io).

The latter one is currently the reason why I became so addicted to Streamlit. Despite its ~~lack of support for `geopandas`~~ or adding legends, numerous options to draw maps including **Choropleth** were quite mind-blowing. With its multi-layer, I had no problems to overlay multiple measures in one map, i.e., Choropleth with depths.
