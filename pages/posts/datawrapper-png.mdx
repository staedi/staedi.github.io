description: How to embed Datawrapper Chart as in static image
---

Previously, in this [article](datawrapper-mdx), I showed how to embed [Datawrapper](https://datawrapper.de) chart using **responsive iframe**. 

While, it's good to showcase an interactive chart to audience, it loads slowly compared to static image.


## How to embed in static image?

Compared to embedding script, this is fairly easy.

First see the last script I used to embed **responsive iframe** in `MDX`. 

```js showLineNumbers
import Script from 'next/script'
export const style = "width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;";
<iframe title="Weighted Sentiment Scores (Exchange)" aria-label="Dot Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-0bwFo" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0bwFo/1/" scrolling="no" frameBorder="0" style={{style}} height="495"></iframe>
<Script src="http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lib/embed.min.js" />
```

For static image, it becomes one line with different href (*obviously*).

```md

```


## How is it displayed in action?
