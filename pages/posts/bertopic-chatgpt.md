## Before begin

This is an ongoing project to enhance `BERTopic` **Topic Classification** leveraging `ChatGPT`.


## `ChatGPT` and `BERTopic`

As I wrote in the [previous article](chatgpt), the recent version of `BERTopic` started to support `ChatGPT` for its extracted **Topic Classification** results. With `ChatGPT`'s excellent capacity to explain given available information, generating a well-understood topic sentence was the smart move.

**Caveat**? `ChatGPT`'s infamous ability to generate a plausible explanation, even when it's not true at all.


## Why `ChatGPT`?

Arguably, `ChatGPT` is the most hyped **generative AI** which unlocked and still does a lot of opportunities in the field.

However, it is not the only available tool in the market and without a free credit of **OpenAPI**, there's no way to use `ChatGPT` in a programmatic way for free.

With *rate limit*, there are other companies which provide similar functions to `ChatGPT`. I tried [Cohere](https://cohere.ai) as it offers a free and rate-limiting pricing option.

Unfortunately, the result was not so impressive especially in Korean language texts.


## Visualization Methodologies

As before, I drew the **Topic Classification** result using `visx`'s **Circle Packing** chart to depict the hierarchy among topics. 

However, unlike before, I replaced the **Wordcloud** chart for *hierarchy-less* **Circle Packing** to show each individual topic.

I changed in this way as I believe that `ChatGPT`-generate topics have enough to say and **Wordcloud** is not very useful more or less especially even **unigram** word tokenizations.

## Closing

Obviously, `ChatGPT` alone might not be perfect for the text analytics, but its powerful explainability is the game changer.

As with any other ML tasks, finding the best (hyperparameter) setting for the topic clustering is still the big issue.
