## Pip extras

In many Python packages, installation is given with extras and it is written as follows.

```py
pip install spacy[apple]
```

This is to install [`spaCy`](https://spacy.io) package along with dependencies for Apple Silicon-based macs.


## What's the problem?

Whenever I tried to install this specific package for my M1-Macbook Air, my shell complained and refused to work.

Then, it happened to me that the problem might be the shell, as Apple adopted `zsh` as the default shell since Catalina. Going forward, every Mac OS has been shipped with it, including `Big Sur`, the first OS pre-installed with Apple Silicon chips.

In other words, there is no way to make this specific command works on the `zsh` shell.

To verify, I ran the same command with the `bash` shell and it confirmed my theory as the command ran as I expected.


## No solution, then?

Of course not.

One obvious solution would to change the default shell back to `bash`, if I wouldn't recommend for conda (or mamba) users. The usual `conda activate` (or `mamba activate`) didn't work for me as I installed it on the `zsh` shell.


Rather, just changing the command by a bit makes it work with the `zsh` shell. That is, add **\** before the bracket starts.

For instance, the same command I wrote at the start would be like this.

```py
pip install spacy\[apple]
```

Done.


In case, you need a specific version of the package, the same thing applies.

```py
pip install spacy\[apple]==3.4.4
```

La fin.
