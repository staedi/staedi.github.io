## Motivation

As a text analytics practioner with a focus on financial news, Topic Classification is one of the core jobs for me. For that purpose, `BERTopic` changed my job much easier compared to when I had to rely on `Word2Vec`. However, it's not a panacea and I've been tinkering with it to get a better insight. 

With `visualize_hierarchy()` method, `BERTopic` provides a way to view hierarchy in the form of **dendrogram**. However, as dendrogram depicts nodes with varying depths, it's rather difficult to grasp the hierarchy. 


## Methodologies

This leads me to find more plausible ways to capture the hierarchy in not so complicated way.


### Initial try: Collapsible Tree

Initially, what I wanted to employ was **Collapsible Tree**. As the name suggests, in **Collapsible Tree**, nodes which have children can be collapsed simply by clicking and expanded by doing it again.

As this tree seemed to save the space by collapsing nodes of no interests, I initially thought that would be a good candidate to use instead of **Dendrogram**.

However, with deep levels and plenty of nodes, the layout is messy and the linear structure (left to right, for instance) didn't make it a decent choice for my purpose.


### Circle packing

Next, as I was browsing [D3 Observable Gallery](https://observablehq.com/collection/@d3/charts), I came across another brilliant hierarchical chart, namely **Circle Packing**.

This seemed more plausible since multiple levels are compacted into a circle with several children in it, thereby saving spaces than **Trees**.

Moreover, with added interactive elements (**Tooltips**, **Highlights when MouseOver**) provided by `visx`, I settled with this type of chart. 


### Wordcloud

In general, I don't like **Wordcloud**.

While it can be effective when used for the purpose, it has been used too many times without real contexts (remember *WordArt* ?). 

I might have been too harsh with **Wordcloud**, as I tried to avoid it at all costs. However, for the **Topic Classification and Brainstorming**, I came to think that this might be it.

For getting an idea of what the news outlet has talked about, **Wordcloud** can shed a light even without precise preprocessing steps.
