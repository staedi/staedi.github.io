Hey, I'm a Data Practitioner with combined expertise in Analytics, Science and Engineering in the finance domain.
My background involves streamlining processes in need of a change and testing out new methodologies.

I am enthusiastic about `NLP` and `Data Visualization`. Specifically, my focus is to simplify things for better analyses (`NLP`) or insights (`Data Visualization`).
Additionally, I constantly intend to learn and apply up-to-date skills as well, like `Next.js`, which powers this site.

You can reach me at [`LinkedIn`](https://linkedin.com/in/min-park) and [`GitHub`](https://github.com/staedi).
