# Overview

This GitHub Page(s) is/are built with `React.js`-based **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/). Specifically, it used the [`nextra-theme-blog`](https://github.com/vercel/nextjs-portfolio-starter) theme.

Few minimal customizations were done for this work thanks to the beautiful theme.

## Compositions

This GitHub Page(s) include(s) two pages.

- Main Page
- Articles

### Main Page

In the main page, along with brief introduction, I presented notable **Projects** (***Works***) I have been either professionally or personally.

Some of the projects might have `GitHub` repo links if the works are public and are documented.

### Articles

Here are articles I have written so far. I categorized each article as either **NLP**, **Development**, **Project**, or **Miscellaneous**.

Except *Project*, I've mainly written tips and tricks either in **development** perspective or else.

In the **Project** category, I documented my works which mostly have `GitHub` repo links as well.


## Why Next.js?

My intention was purely aesthetic perspective (with minimal modifications for my purpose). As a non-frontend developer, what I wanted was simple but elegant layouts.

After using `Jekyll` for more than 2 years, I wanted to have a template which provides a clean interface (just like `GitHub`?) for *code view* or [Medium](https://medium.com)-like.

While browsing the web, I came across `Gatsby`, another `React.js` framework. Unfortunately, it was close but no cigar for me. I couldn't find **the one** that caught me as close as `Next.js` provides.

I admit that it's a bit weird reason to choose a development platform but that gave me an execuse to delve into the frontend dev.

So far, I am satisfied with this well-made framework (mostly this template) despite a little room to improve (e.g., no **pagination**).
