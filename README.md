# Overview

This GitHub Page(s) is/are built with `React.js`-based **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). Specifically, it used the [`nextra-theme-blog`](https://github.com/vercel/nextjs-portfolio-starter) theme.

Only minimal customizations were done for this work thanks to the beautiful theme.


## Compositions

This GitHub Page(s) include(s) two pages.

- Main Page
- Articles

### Main Page

In the main page, along with brief introduction, I presented notable **Projects** (***Works***) I have been either professionally or personally.

Some of the projects might have `GitHub` repo links if the works are public and are documented.

### Articles

Here are articles I have written so far. I categorized each article as either **Development**, **Project**, or **Miscellaneous**.

Except *Project*, I've mainly written tips and tricks either in **development** perspective or else.

In the **Project** category, I documented my works which mostly have `GitHub` repo links as well.


## Why Next.js?

My intention was purely design perspective (or theme readily available). As a non-frontend developer, what I wanted was simple but elegant layouts. 

After using `Jekyll` for more than 2 years, I came across `Gatsby`, another `React.js` framework. Unfortunately, I couldn't find one that satisfies my need as close as `Next.js` does.

While there is still room to improve (this specific theme lacks **pagination** for blog articles display), it is well-made and pretty satisfying.
